Hi! I am Pengji Zhang and you have reached my personal website. In my day job, I
mostly do mathematical modeling of transportation networks and software
development.

Outside of my job, I have a passion for programming in general, and I am
especially interested in systems programming, computer graphics, and GPGPU. Here
are some of my hobby projects:

- [chip8hs]: a [CHIP-8] virtual machine with a TUI.
- [expose]: a Linux tool for inspecting the outputs of another running process.
  I wrote this tool to scratch my own itch. It still has some flaws that I do
  not know how to solve (see the comments in the source file), but it has been
  working really well for me.
- [coro]: a stackful coroutine demo in C99. This was also my first attempt on a
  libc-free program. It is based on various things I learned mainly from [Chris
  Wellons] -- arena allocator, direct Linux system calls, and also his original
  implementation for Windows.
- [texbox]: my own LaTeX classes, styles, and other tools.

All of those projects are dedicated to the public domain. I hope my hobby
projects could be helpful to you, and I appreciate comments, suggestions, and
criticisms on the mistakes I made (or other things).

I am eager to learn new things, and I would like to share my thoughts about the
topics and techniques I have learned on either of the two blogs. However, I was
having a hard time in the past three years, and so there have been no updates to
the blogs for a long time. Things start to get better now. I am planning to
overhaul this website in the near future and start writing again soon.
