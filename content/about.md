Hi! My name is Pengji Zhang and this is my personal website and blog.

## Contact

If you would like to get in touch, please send me an email to the address
[me@pengjiz.com][email].

## This website

This website is built with [Hugo] using the *simple* theme crafted by me. You
can find the source code for this website [on GitHub][repo]. [Netlify]
automatically builds the website and serves it through their CDN, using a TLS
certificate from [Let's Encrypt]. The icons used at the bottom are from the
[Feather] project.

All the information on this website, unless otherwise noted, is hereby released
into the public domain, with no rights reserved. Feel free to use them for
anything in any way you like.

## Privacy

I will not collect any data on this website. It does not use Google Analytics or
anything similar. However, it does use [Google Fonts] for web fonts, [jsDelivr]
for loading [MathJax], and [Netlify] for hosting. They may collect visitors'
information so you may want to check their privacy policies.
