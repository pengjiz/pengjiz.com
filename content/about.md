Hi! My name is Pengji Zhang and this is my homepage and blog.

## Contact

Currently I am living in beautiful Pittsburgh, United States. If you would like
to get in touch, please send me an email. My email address is
[me@pengjiz.com](mailto:me@pengjiz.com). I will be happy to talk with you.

## This Site

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the theme is crafted by
me. The icons used (at the bottom of each page) are from the wonderful
[Feather](https://feathericons.com/) project. You can find the source code of
this site [here](https://github.com/pengjiz/pengjiz.com).
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) automatically builds the site after each
commit and serves it through their CDN, using a TLS certificate from [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

All the information on this site, unless otherwise noted, is hereby released
into the public domain, with no rights reserved. Feel free to use them for
anything in any way you like. I appreciate crediting, but that is not mandatory
by any means.

## Privacy

I do not collect any data on this site. It does not use Google Analytics or
anything similar. However, it does use Google fonts and is hosted on Netlify, so
their privacy policies apply, and hey may collect visitors' information.
