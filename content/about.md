Hi! My name is Pengji Zhang and this is my personal homepage and blog.

## Contact

Currently I am living in beautiful Pittsburgh, United States. If you would like
to get in touch, please send me an email to the address [me@pengjiz.com][email].

## This site

This site is built with [Hugo] using the *simple* theme crafted by me. You can
find the source code of this site [on GitHub][repo]. [Netlify] automatically
builds the site and serves it through their CDN, using a TLS certificate from
[Let's Encrypt]. The icons used at the bottom are from the [Feather] project.

All the information on this site, unless otherwise noted, is hereby released
into the public domain, with no rights reserved. Feel free to use them for
anything in any way you like.

## Privacy

I will not collect any data on this site. It does not use Google Analytics or
anything similar. However, it does use [Google Fonts] for web fonts, [jsDelivr]
for loading [MathJax], and [Netlify] for hosting. They may collect visitors'
information so you may want to check their privacy policies.
